In this situation, a standard would be determined and registered by the ACMA in place of an industry-developed code in situations where the ACMA feels industry codes are inadequate or haven't been developed or where the code would take too long to develop considering the urgency or exceptional circumstances. This should not be inferred or determined by implications from other comments. If the submitter does not make explicit comments on this aspect, return null. If the submission makes explicit comments on the proposal for the ACMA to have a standard-making power, your response needs to first select which of the following positions the submission most closely aligns with:\n\n1.

Not supportive.\n\nQualified support may be the case where the submission views it as a reasonable or necessary power, but greater safeguards are needed.
