Substantive submissions are those that provide a detailed or well reasoned response to the consultation. Screenshots of memes or other pre-existing content are not considered substantive. Submissions relying on conspiracy theories are not considered substantive. A submission expressing purely personal opinion, without any supporting argument, is not considered substantive. Consider the supplementary materials and determine if the submission substantively answers the issues, concerns and questions raised in the consultation."

Political (e.g. politician or political part), 3. Digital Platform (e.g. Meta, Microsoft, Google, etc.), 4. Civil Society (e.g. NGO, advocacy group, etc.), 5. Academic, 6. News (e.g. a news company such as News Corp, ABC or Nine News, or an industry association representing news organisations such as Australian Press Council, Commerical Radio Australia or FreeTV), 7. Government (e.g. government agencies such as Victorian Electoral Commission or Australian Human Rights Commission), 8. Industry (An industry body that does not neatly fit within the predefined categories (e.g. while Commerical Radio Australia represents news broadcasters and as such fits within News, an industry body such as Communications Alliance, which represents communications providers such as a telcos and broadband companies would fit here)), 9. Other (please specify). Only return the category that best describes the responder. E.g. for a submission from the UTS Centre for Media Transition, you would return: 'Academic'."
