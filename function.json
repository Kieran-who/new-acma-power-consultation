Political (e.g. politician or political part), 3. Digital Platform (e.g. Meta, Microsoft, Google, etc.), 4. Civil Society (e.g. NGO, advocacy group, etc.), 5. Academic, 6.

Government (e.g. government agencies such as Victorian Electoral Commission or Australian Human Rights Commission), 8. Industry (An industry body that does not neatly fit within the predefined categories (e.g. while Commercial Radio Australia represents news broadcasters and as such fits within News, an industry body such as Communications Alliance, which represents communications providers such as a telcos and broadband companies would fit here)), 9. Other (please specify). Only return the category that best describes the responder. E.g. for a submission from the UTS Centre for Media Transition, you would return: 'Academic'."

For example, does the submission comment on the practicality, feasibility or merits of self-regulation, codes of practice, industry standards or direct government regulation (i.e. in the form of direct legislation)? This question is only interested in specific comments from the submission on the FORM OF REGULATION and NOT whether or not the issue should be regulated. It is also not interested in the submission's view as to what the impacts of regulation may be. We are also not interested in the submission's view of the impacts that regulation, in general, will have. WE ARE ONLY interested in specific comments as to the form of regulation (e.g. self-regulation, quasi-regulation, co-regulation, industry codes of practice, industry-regulator collaboration, industry standards, Direct government regulation, etc.). If the submission makes explicit comments as to the preferred form of regulation, please return what the preferred form is. The options are: 1. Self-regulation\n2. Quasi-regulation\n3. Co-regulation\n4. Direct regulation. If no comment on this issue, return 'No comment'. To help you understand the meanings of the different forms of regulation for this task, here is an overview of each:\n\n**Self-regulation**\n\nSelf-regulation is generally characterised by industry-formulated rules and codes of conduct, with industry solely responsible for enforcement.\nFor example, the content of advertising is subject to a self-regulatory system created by the Australian Association of National Advertisers (AANA) in 1998. The AANA established a Code of Ethics and the Advertising Standards Bureau (ASB), which incorporates an independent Advertising Standards Board to hear complaints regarding advertising content.\nThe ‘classification’ of audio material is also self-regulated, under the Recorded Music Labelling Code of Practice. There is no legislation and individual record companies are responsible for labelling recordings under a code that outlines labelling provisions and establishes a complaints-handling mechanism.\nThe processes and procedures followed by video-sharing websites and other internet content providers in controlling content that they sell or distribute may also be characterised as a form of self-regulation. These processes include responding to user reporting (or ‘flagging’) of inappropriate content and methods to detect inappropriate content using algorithms and other technical means. For example, YouTube users click a flag button to report a video which they consider to be inappropriate and flagged videos are routed into ‘smart’ queues for manual review by a specialist review team before a decision is made whether to take the video down, or age-restrict it.\n\n---\n\n**Quasi-regulation**\n\nQuasi-regulation describes those arrangements where government influences businesses to comply, but which do not form part of explicit government regulation.\nAn example of quasi-regulation is the agreement by Telstra, Optus and Primus to filter voluntarily a list of child abuse URLs compiled and maintained by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (the ACMA). This arrangement was entered into against the background of the Australian Government’s proposed system for mandatory internet service provider level filtering of URLs. \nArguably, the AANA self-regulatory system for advertising might equally be characterised as quasi-regulation. This is because governments may have regulated this area if a self-regulatory regime did not exist—and may regulate in the future if this regime does not demonstrate its responsiveness to community expectations.\n\n---\n\n**Co-regulation**\n\nCo-regulation typically refers to situations where industry develops and administers its own arrangements, but government provides legislative backing to enable the arrangements to be enforced.\nRegulation of radio and television content is co-regulatory. Various industry groups have developed codes under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth). Most aspects of program content are governed by these codes, which include the Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice and the Commercial Radio Australia Code of Practice and Guidelines. Once implemented, the ACMA monitors these codes and deals with unresolved complaints made under them.\n\n---\n\n**Direct government regulation**\n\nDirect government regulation comprises primary and subordinate legislation. It is the most commonly used form of regulation. Direct government regulation applies to the classification of publications, films and computer games under the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 (Cth) (Classification Act)."
