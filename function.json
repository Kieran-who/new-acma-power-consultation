Based on the response (especially the name of the responder - e.g. if it is a company or group), please select the category that best describes the responder. Options are: 1. Individual, 2. Political (e.g. politician or political part), 3. Digital Platform (e.g. Meta, Microsoft, Google, etc.), 4. Civil Society (e.g. NGO, advocacy group, etc.), 5. Academic, 6. News (e.g. a news company such as News Corp, ABC or Nine News, or an industry association representing news organisations such as Australian Press Council, Commercial Radio Australia or FreeTV), 7. Government (e.g. government agencies such as the Victorian Electoral Commission or Australian Human Rights Commission), 8. Industry (An industry body that does not neatly fit within the predefined categories (e.g. while Commercial Radio Australia represents news broadcasters and as such fits within News, an industry body such as Communications Alliance, which represents communications providers such as telcos and broadband companies would fit here)), 9. Other (please specify). Only return the category that best describes the responder. E.g. for a submission from the UTS Centre for Media Transition, you would return: 'Academic'."

          "description": "Does this submission make any comment as to the preferred form of regulation? For example, does the submission comment on the practicality, feasibility or merits of self-regulation, co-regulation or direct/government regulation? This question is only interested in specific comments from the submission on the FORM OF REGULATION and NOT whether or not the issue should be regulated. It is also not interested in the submission's view as to what the impacts of regulation may be. We are also not interested in the submission's view of the impacts that regulation, in general, will have. WE ARE ONLY interested in specific comments as to the form of regulation (e.g. self-regulation, co-regulation, direct/government regulation). If the submission makes explicit comments as to the preferred form of regulation, please return what the preferred form is. The options are: 1. Self-regulation\n2. Co-regulation\n3. Government/direct regulation\n4. No regulation. If no comment on this issue, return 'No comment'. To help you understand the meanings of the different forms of regulation for this task, here is an overview of each:\n\n**Self-regulation**\n\nSelf-regulation is generally characterised by industry-formulated rules and codes of conduct, with industry solely responsible for enforcement.\nFor example, the content of advertising is subject to a self-regulatory system created by the Australian Association of National Advertisers (AANA) in 1998. The AANA established a Code of Ethics. The related organisation Ad Standards operates a community panel that hear complaints regarding advertising content. Similarly, the Australian Press Council (APC) administers a self-regulatory scheme for print and online news. APC formulates principles and standards and takes complaints from the public, which are heard by adjudication panels.\nThe ‘classification’ of audio material is also self-regulated under the Recorded Music Labelling Code of Practice. There is no legislation, and individual record companies are responsible for labelling recordings under a code that outlines labelling provisions and establishes a complaints handling mechanism.\n\n---\n\n**Co-regulation**\n\nCo-regulation typically refers to situations where industry develops and administers its own arrangements, but government provides legislative backing to enable the arrangements to be enforced.\nRegulation of radio and television content is co-regulatory. Various industry groups have developed codes under Part 9 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth). Most aspects of program content are governed by these codes, which include the Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice and the Commercial Radio Australia Code of Practice and Guidelines. Once implemented, the ACMA monitors these codes and deals with unresolved complaints made under them. A similar scheme applies to telecommunications codes developed under Part 6 of the Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth), such as the Telecommunications Consumer Protections Code.\n\n---\n\n**Direct/government regulation**\n\nDirect government regulation comprises primary and subordinate legislation as well as rules developed by a government regulator. It is the most commonly used form of regulation. Examples of direct government regulation are: industry standards developed under Part 6 of the Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth); programs standards developed under Part 9 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth); the Broadcasting Services (Events) Notice 2023; the Online Safety (Basic Online Safety Expectations) Determination 2022; Guidelines for the Classification of Films 2012.\n\n---\n\n**No regulation**\n\nNo regulation is where there is no form of self-regulation, co-regulation or direction/government regulation. It includes situations where a company develops terms of use, community guidelines or some other form of rule that apply only to itself. We refer to this last type of arrangement as ‘governance’, but for this exercise, it can be classified as ‘no regulation’."
