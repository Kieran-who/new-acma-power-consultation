## The Issue

Misinformation and disinformation pose a threat to the safety and wellbeing of
Australians, as well as to our democracy, society and economy.

In January 2023, the Minister for Communications announced that the Australian
Government would introduce new laws to provide the independent regulator, the
Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), with new powers to combat
online misinformation and disinformation.

The new powers will enable the ACMA to monitor efforts and require digital
platforms to do more, placing Australia at the forefront in tackling harmful
online misinformation and disinformation, while balancing freedom of speech.

The proposed powers would:

- enable the ACMA to gather information from digital platform providers, or
  require them to keep certain records about matters regarding misinformation
  and disinformation
- enable the ACMA to request industry develop a code of practice covering
  measures to combat misinformation and disinformation on digital platforms,
  which the ACMA could register and enforce
- allow the ACMA to create and enforce an industry standard (a stronger form of
  regulation), should a code of practice be deemed ineffective in combatting
  misinformation and disinformation on digital platforms. The ACMA will not have
  the power to request specific content or posts be removed from digital
  platform services.

The ACMA powers will strengthen and support the existing voluntary framework
established by the Australian Code of Practice on Disinformation and
Misinformation (the voluntary code), and will extend to non-signatories of the
voluntary code.

These powers are consistent with the key recommendations in the ACMA's June 2021
Report to government on the adequacy of digital platforms' disinformation and
news quality measures.
